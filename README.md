# Discrete-event Simulation
In this work I implement a discrete-event simulation model based on a bank tellers staffing system. From this, conclusions are drawn about what this analysis might imply for a bank, or more broadly a business using cashiers or tellers (at a basic level).

See `assignment4.pdf` for further details on the task and `Peter_Akioyamen_250949002_AS4.pdf` for completed analysis. `C++` was used for simulation.
